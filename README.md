# vQbe data structures

## Functionality

- [ ] Linked-list
- [ ] Array-list
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Heap
- [ ] Hash map

## Usage
You should select exactly one C/C++ source file that instantiates the code, preferably a file you're not editing frequently. This file should define a specific macro (depending on the used data structure) to actually enable the function definitions.

### Examples

```c
#include ...
#include ...
#define VQBE_LINKED_LIST_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "linked_list.h"
```
